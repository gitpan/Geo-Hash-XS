=head1 NAME

Geo::Hash::XS - Geo::Hash in XS

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $gh = Geo::Hash::XS->new();
    my $hash = $gh->encode( $lat, $lon );  # default precision = 32
    my $hash = $gh->encode( $lat, $lon, $precision ); 
    my ($lat, $lon) = $gh->decode( $hash );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Geo::Hash::XS encodes and decodes geohash strings, fast. 

Currently this module is alpha quality (especially the C<adjacent()> and C<negihbors()> methods, which I just kind of copied the logic from elsewhere). Please submit tests and patches!

=head1 METHODS

=head2 $gh = Geo::Hash::XS->new()

=head2 $hash = $gh->encode($lat, $lon[, $precision])

One notable difference between Geo::Hash::XS and Geo::Hash is that
encode() does NOT dynamically adjust the precision when $precision is not
given. If not given, $precision is always 32

=head2 ($lat, $lon) = $gh->decode( $hash )

Decodes $hash to $lat and $lon
